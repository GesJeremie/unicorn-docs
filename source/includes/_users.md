If you played with [unicornfm.com](http://www.unicornfm.com) you should know you are able to create, join a server, push songs without registration. This is possible thanks to our concept of **anonymous users**. In fact when you browse our app you are automatically "connected" as an anonymous user.
Thus we are able to know who is the owner of a server, who pushed a song, etc.

  Most of the endpoints of the API will ask for an user token.
