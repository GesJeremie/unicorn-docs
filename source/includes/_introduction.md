# Introduction

<aside class="warning">
Unicornfm isn't released yet and is currently in development. If you see that, it means you are a fucking-very early user and you should be proud (and almost nothing listed here will work :p.)

Welcome to the UnicornFM API documentation!

This API is the core of UnicornFM, think of [unicornfm.com](http://www.unicornfm.com) like a fancy UI wrapper around it. It means you could be able to create your own unicorn app or whatever you could think of, we we are very excited to see what you gonna build with it!

  Note - We would love to see a Slack / Messenger bot to push songs ...<br/>
